In classical mechanics it's assumed from the experiment evidence a **criterion of reality** that is an objective pre-existence of the value of physical properties independently from any observation. The process of a **measurement** is just the revealing of these values that are related to an object or to an effect. In this principle this measurement does not perturb the physical entities to be measured, so the results are said to be **deterministic** and are not influenced by previous measurements.

This all means that in classical physics a measure with an **arbitrary precision** and in a **deterministic way** any **physical property** of a macroscopic entity, without appreciably perturbing it. So we can determine simultaneously both the position and velocity of a macroscopic object. This situation is completely different when dealing with microscopic objects like [[Photon]] due to their small mass. So the scattering light by electrons produces a relevant **perturbation** as effect of the measurement process. So it is no more possible to consider the results of measurements on microscopic entities as independent from the process for measurement. 

For this reason we can't speak about an **objective** value of the physical quantity in the microscopic world because we can observe it in a deterministic way. 
### Heisenberg principle of indetermination

In 1927 Heisenberg proposed a thought experiment for measuring the position of an electron by observing with a microscope the light scattered by the electron. To increase the precision in the localization of the electron it's necessary to reduce the wavelength of the illuminating radiation, causing an increase of the momentum of the [[Photon]] incident of the electron and, hence a greater perturbation. So the **principle of indetermination** states that
$$
\Delta x\Delta p_{x} \approx h
$$
where $\Delta x$ is the precision in the measurement of the position coordinate $x$ while $\Delta p_{x}$ is the precision of the measurement. In classical mechanics position and momentum form a pair of canonically conjugate physical quantity. In quantum mechanics they are **complementary**. Hence in quantum physics it's not possible to simultaneously measure with an arbitrary precision both momentum and position.
