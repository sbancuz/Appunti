The sorting algorithm always gives the correct solution, the only variation is the running time. It is done by running the algorithm multiple times with a different random input each time and returning only when it gives get a valid result.

The Las Vegas is efficient if on any input its expected running time is bounded by a  polynomial function of the input size.

Examples of such approach are:
- [[Quicksort]]
- [[I-th selection]]
