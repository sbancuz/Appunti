Machine learning is an area of Artificial intelligence focused on building algorithms capable of learning, **extracting** knowledge from experience. These algorithms cannot **create** knowledge. The goal is to build programs that can make informed decisions on new unseen data.

When the target values are real values, we have a regression problem, when they are discrete we have a classification problem.
A simple method for finding a good regression solution is through the use of a [[Perceptron]] 

Suppose we have the experience we collected encoded as data
$$
D=x_{1},\dots ,x_{n}
$$
We have 3 types of machine learning 
- [[Supervised learning]]
- [[Unsupervised learning]]
- [[Reinforcement learning]]

And each of them has three components
- Representation
- Evaluation
- Optimization
