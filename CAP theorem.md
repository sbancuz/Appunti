Any distributed system where nodes share some data can have at most two of these three desirable properties:
- [[Distributed consistency model|Consistency]]
- High [[availability]]
- Tolerance to network partitions <- **This is not avoidable**

>[!warning]
This means we have to choose either [[availability]] or [[Distributed consistency model|consistency]].
