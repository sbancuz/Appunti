In peer to peer all components play the same role,  so there is no client and no server. This approach resolves some problems of [[Client server]] architecture because it allows the system to scale and removes the single point of failure that was the centralized server. It is an architecture that promotes the sharing of resources and services through direct exchange between peers.

In reality purely peer to peer are rare, usually there is a server that gives 'direction' to other peers on the network.
