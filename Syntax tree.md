A syntax tre is a directed acyclic graph, such that for every pair of nodes there exists one and only one path that connects them. It represents the derivation process and gives parent-children relation of a root-leaf relation. 

- **frontier** -> is the sequence of leaves from left to right
- **degree** -> is the length of the rule

It's used to represent [[Free grammars]], in fact the root represents the axiom and the frontier is the generated phrase.
