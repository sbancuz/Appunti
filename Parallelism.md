Parallelism, in CPUs, means to execute some part of code simultaneously with some other code. There are a couple of classifications for parallelism
- Instruction level parallelism $\to$ using [[CPU Pipelining]], [[VLIW Code scheduling]] or [[Register renaming]]
- Multi-threading $\to$ This can be done with both software [[Threads]], but when dealing with CPUs we mean [[Hardware Threads]]
- Multi-processors
- Data-level parallelism $\to$ [[SIMD]]
