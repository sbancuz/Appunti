Repeat a random algorithm and compute the average of the random variable we are considering. This may not yield the best solution, but can provide a bound of performance. 

There are 2 kinds of Monte Carlo:
- Those with 1 sided errors
- Those with 2 sided errors

The Monte Carlo is efficient if on any input its worst case running time is bounded by a polynomial function of the input size.
