When we need to resolve an optimization problem we have to think about:
- Decisions $\to$ Variables
- Rules $\to$ Mathematical constraints
- Objective $\to$ Functions

### Variables

Variables are used to represent decisions, and can be:
- non negative
$$
\begin{align}
x_{a} = \text{ number of } A  \\
x_{b} = \text{ number of } B 
\end{align}
$$
- unrestricted : they are used to manage perturbations to a current solution
$$
\pi_{i} = \pi_{i}^{+} - \pi_{i}^{-} \text{ where } \pi_{i}^{+},\pi_{i}^{-} \geq 0 
$$
- relative value : it's a fraction of a value
- 0-1 : this represent a logical value
- discrete value

### Rules

The rules are constraints that our system must follow. This are expressed as multi-variable inequalities
$$
x_{a}+ 2x_{b} \leq 15
$$
#### Blending constraints

There can also be blending constraints that require a certain percentage goal to a mix of variables
$$
\frac{35x_{s} + 40 x_{c} + 180 x_{p} + 100 x_{b}}{300 + \dots + 400x_{b}} \geq 30 \%
$$
#### Logical constraint

Binary values can be seen as logical variables and thus can be used to express propositional operator. To use a logical constraint onto real variables we have to create systems
$$
\begin{align}
 y_{1}   = & \begin{cases}
1  &  x_{1} > 0 \\
0  & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} \\
 y_{2}   = & \begin{cases}
1  &  x_2 > 0 \\
0  & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} \\ 
\implies  & \begin{cases}
y_{1} + y_{2} \leq 1 \\
x_{1} \leq M y_{1} \\
x_{2} \leq M y_{2}
\end{cases}
\end{align}
$$
where $M$ is just a big constant or just a limit.
### Transformations

We can transform a rule into another equivalent rule if we need.
$$
\sum_{i} a_{i}x_{i} \leq b \implies\sum_{i} -a_{i}x_{i} \geq -b 
$$
This could be needed if the solver can't work with a certain constraint.
To transform an inequality to an equality we can just add a parameter $s \geq 0$ such that
$$
\sum_{i} a_{i}x_{i} Â± s\leq b
$$
and varying the value of $s$ gives us a discriminant that tells us if our result is equal or not to $b$
