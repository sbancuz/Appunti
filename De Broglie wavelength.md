In 1924 De Broglie extended the [[Particle-wave dualism]] found for the radiation also to matter. So for each microscopic particle there is an associated **matter wave** of wavelength
$$
\lambda = \frac{h}{p} = \frac{h}{mv}
$$
where $p$ is the momentum of a non relativistic motion. So we can rewrite this as
$$
p = \frac{h}{\lambda} = \frac{h}{2\pi}k = \hbar k = mv
$$
