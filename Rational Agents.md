The goal of artificial intelligence is to design rational agents. An agent it's described by it's function $f(\dots)$ that maps a sequence of perceptions to an action. So a rational agent is an agent that for every possible sequence of perceptions chooses the action that maximises the expected value of it's [[Performance measure]], given it's knowledge up to that moment.

An agent can be considered intelligent if it can act rationally given it's knowledge up to that moment.
### Environment

From the perspective of an agent the environment can be:
- fully/partially observable
- single/multi agent
- deterministic or not
- episodic or sequential
- static or dynamic
- discrete or continuous
- known or unknown

An agent can change the status of its environment through actions.
