A right linear grammar may contain alternative rules which cause non-deterministic behaviour.

There are advantages for non determinism:
- The correspondence between grammars and automata. This means that they can have more destination states, $\epsilon$-moves and more than one initial state
- The automaton is concise and may be more readable than a deterministic one
