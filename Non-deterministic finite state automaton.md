A right linear grammar may contain alternative rules which cause non-deterministic behaviour.

There are advantages for non determinism:
- The correspondence between grammars and automata. This means that they can have more destination states, $\epsilon$-moves and more than one initial state
- The automaton is concise and may be more readable than a deterministic one
- Left-right duality
- Passing through a non-deterministic automaton may be convenient to construct the deterministic one

A non-deterministic finite state automaton $N$ without spontaneous moves has:
- a finite set of states $Q$ divided in
	- initial states $I$
	- final states $F$ 
- a finite input $\Sigma$
- a set $\delta$ of transitions
### Transition function

The moves of the non-deterministic automaton can be defined by means of a many-valued transition function. Given the non-deterministic automaton $N$ with spontaneous moves $\delta$ is defined as such
$$
\delta: Q \times (\Sigma \cup \{ \epsilon \}) \to \phi(Q)
$$
### Uniqueness of the initial state

An automaton may have multiple states but it's easy to construct an equivalent automaton with only one initial state. We just have to connect the initial states by a new single initial state and connect them with $\epsilon$-arcs.
### Correspondence between grammar

![[grammar vs ndfsm.png]]

A language is generated by a right-linear grammar if and only if it is recognized by a finite automaton.
### Ambiguity

Being an automaton, it is ambiguous by definition. An automaton is ambiguous if the corresponding grammar is so, i.e., if a string $x$ labels 2 or more accepting paths
