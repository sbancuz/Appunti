This algorithm is divided in 2 phases:
1) Construct the complement of the set $DEF$ of the defined non-terminal symbols
2) The identification of the non-terminal symbols that are reachable starting from $S$ can be reduced to the problem of the existence of a path in the graph defined as $A\to B \text{ iff } A\neq B$
