This is an algorithm that constructs a [[Finite state automata]] from a regex constructing a deterministic recognizer without spontaneous moves.

To do so, it transforms the generic regex to a numbered one by applying a running index to each of them. Consider the end marked regex $e$  $â”¤$ instead of the original regex $e$. We define the set $FOL(c_{\#})$ of the followers of $c_{\#} \in \Sigma_{\#}$
