In distributed computing, a **remote procedure call** (**RPC**) is when a computer program causes a procedure to execute on a shared network, which is written as if it were a normal (local) procedure call. That is, the programmer writes essentially the same code whether the subroutine is local to the executing program, or remote. This is a form of [[Client server]] interaction, typically implemented via a requestâ€“response message-passing system. In the object-oriented programming paradigm, RPCs are represented by remote method invocation (RMI). 

The RPC model implies a level of location transparency, namely that calling procedures are largely the same whether they are local or remote, but usually, they are not identical, so local calls can be distinguished from remote calls. Remote calls are usually orders of magnitude slower and less reliable than local calls, so distinguishing them is important.

### IDL

The interface definition language raises the level of abstraction. Given the types and the interfaces, it generates the stub code that needs to perform the communication layer.

### Server resolution

To find out which server provides a given service you can either hard-code the server information of try to find it out through the network.

To resolve this problem it was developed $portmap$, a daemon decodes the packet and binds calls and server/ports.
There is also a directory machine that enables location transparency.

### Asynchronous RPC

RPC preserves the usual call behavior, but the execution resumes after the server responds with the acknowledge and goes on. To deal with the results of the call, the callee may invoke the caller back. 
The implementation of RPC also batches the calls to optimize the procedures.

### RMI

Is the object-oriented version of RPC, in this remote object can be passed around, but the core concepts and mechanisms with RPC remains the same. Here IDL can handle inheritance, exception handling, etc...
