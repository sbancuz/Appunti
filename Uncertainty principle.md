The generalized version of the [[Criterion of reality#Heisenberg principle of indetermination]] is to define the uncertainty of measuring two [[Measurement#Simultaneously measurable observable]].
$$
(\Delta A)_{\psi}(\Delta B)_{\psi} \geq \frac{1}{2} \left|\left< [\hat{A},\hat{B}] \right>\right| _{\psi} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{\left|\left< \psi | [\hat{A},\hat{B}]\psi  \right> \right|}{\left< \psi | \psi \right> }
$$
