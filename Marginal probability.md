The **marginal distribution** of a subset of [[Probability theory#Random variables]] is the probability distribution of the variables contained in the subset. It gives the probabilities of various values of the variables in the subset without reference to the values of the other variables. 

**Marginal variables** are those variables in the subset of variables being retained. These concepts are "marginal" because they can be found by summing values in a table along rows or columns, and writing the sum in the margins of the table. The distribution of the marginal variables (the marginal distribution) is obtained by **marginalizing** -- that is, focusing on the sums in the margin. We can write a general marginalization rule as such
$$
P(Y) = \sum P(Y, Z=z) = \sum P (Y | z)P(z)
$$
