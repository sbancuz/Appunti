It's the study of the techniques to allow secure communication and data storage in presence of attackers. With cryptography we want to ensure:
- Confidentiality $\to$ data can be accessed only by chosen entities
- Integrity $\to$ prevent tampering or replays
- Authenticity $\to$ data and their origin are certified
- Non-repudiation $\to$ creator cannot repudiate data
- Advanced features $\to$ proof of knowledge
### Kerchoff's principles of ciphers
1) It must be **practically** unbreakable
2) It should be possible to make it public
3) The key must be communicable without written notes and changeable
4) Applicable to telegraphic communication
5) It must be portable and operable by just one person
6) It should be easy to use
