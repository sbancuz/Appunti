It's the study of the techniques to allow secure communication and data storage in presence of attackers. With cryptography we want to ensure:
- Confidentiality $\to$ data can be accessed only by chosen entities
- Integrity $\to$ prevent tampering or replays
- Authenticity $\to$ data and their origin are certified
- Non-repudiation $\to$ creator cannot repudiate data
- Advanced features $\to$ proof of knowledge
