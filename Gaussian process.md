A process is said to be Gaussian if, for any $n \in \mathbb Z^{+}$, given a set of instants $t_{1},\dots,t_{n}$ and the random variables $v(t_{1}),\dots,v(t_{n})$ are jointly Gaussian.

A stationary process is said to be **ergodic** if its statistical properties can be derived from the analysis of one realization. In other words the average sample over a realization tends to the expected value.
$$
\lim_{ n \to \infty } {\frac{1}{n}\sum_{1}^{n}i v(t)} = \mathbb  E[v(t)]
$$
