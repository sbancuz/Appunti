We can characterize the quantum harmonic oscillator with the eigenvalues given from this energy function
$$
E_{n} = \left( 1 + \frac{1}{2} \right)h \nu
$$
with corresponding $\phi_{n}$ eigenfunction. These function are also hermitian-Gaussian functions. In this system the eigenvalues are correlated to the spin of the electron
$$
\lambda_{1} = \frac{1}{2}\hbar \qquad \lambda_{2}=-\frac{1}{2}\hbar
$$

In this case we can make [[Measurement]] with respect to the axis of the spin. This is also a physical implementation of the **qbit** in $\mathcal H_{2}$. To continue with this example, the eigenfunctions would be **spin-up** and **spin-down** along some axis $\xi$.
