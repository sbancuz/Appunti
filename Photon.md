Photons are the elemental particle of **light**. They were theorized by Einstein to explain the **photoelectric effect** -- the emission of electrons by a body of metal induced by the absorption of light. 
$$
E_{photon} = hv = \hbar \omega
$$
This is needed because classical theory does not explain why the photo-emission happens when the frequency of light is greater than some threshold. Using a concept of a photon, the emission of an electron is induced by the absorption of a single photon with energy at least equal the the work function of the metal
$$
E_{photon} = hv \geq W \qquad v\geq \frac{W}{h}
$$
