The CIA paradigm for information security states three requirements:
- **confidentiality** $\to$ only authorized entities can access
- **integrity** $\to$ information can be modified only by authorized entities
- **availability** $\to$ information must be available to all parties

A **vulnerability** is a function of a system that allows to violate one of the constraints of the CIA paradigm. An **exploit** is a specific way to use one or more vulnerability to accomplish a specific objective that violates the constraints.
