This represents an [[Autoregressive process]] with a input and $n_{a} = 0$, it's called the Finite Impulse Response. This type of process is characterized by the following input-output equation
$$
y(y) = B(z)u(t-1) + \eta(t)
$$
And the output is a linear combination of a *finite* number of past input data
$$
G(z) + B(z) =b_{0} + b_{1}z^{-1} + \dots + b_{nb}z^{-nv}
$$
